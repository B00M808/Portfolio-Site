# Portfolio Site
 Server Side JavaScript

Created a gorgeous portfolio site to showcase some of the great projects I've built. The site contains a modern landing page, an about page where I have shared contact info, and a series of project pages that shows off and details at least my first five projects while pursuing a Techdegree.

A JSON file was created to store all the data about the projects created.

Pug was used to complete provided templates that utilized the JSON to generate the markup that is ultimately displayed in the browser.

Also used Node.js and Express to:

Import the required dependencies
Link the JSON with the Pug templates
Set up routes to handle requests
Set up the middleware to utilize static files like CSS
Handle errors
Set up a server to serve the project
